                <h2>Color Combinations</h2>
                <p>
                    The color wheel is a visual representation of colors arranged according to their chromatic relationship. It helps to understand and create color combinations based on complementary, analogous, and triadic color schemes.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Complementary Colors:</strong> Colors located opposite each other on the color wheel. They create high contrast and vibrant looks. For example, red and green.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analogous Colors:</strong> Colors located next to each other on the color wheel. They create serene and comfortable designs. For example, blue, blue-green, and green.</li>
                    <li><strong>Triadic Colors:</strong> Colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel. They provide a balanced and harmonious color scheme. For example, red, yellow, and blue.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Color Theory</h2>
                <p>
                    Color theory explores how colors interact with one another and how they can be used in design to convey different emotions and messages. Key concepts include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary Colors:</strong> The three primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. They cannot be created by mixing other colors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary Colors:</strong> These are created by mixing two primary colors. For example, green (blue + yellow), orange (red + yellow), and purple (red + blue).</li>
                    <li><strong>Tertiary Colors:</strong> These are formed by mixing a primary color with a secondary color. For example, red-orange, yellow-green, and blue-purple.</li>
                </ul>
